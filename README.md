# trains

A simple ROBLOX game that allows a fun way to program trains without interfering in my factorio game.

The module can be ported wherever possible, as this just provides a way to have trains follow a path.
This system does not use any pathfinding, but simply serves a way to simulate train bogies and stuff.

## Features

* Bogies
* Curved tracks
* Straight tracks
